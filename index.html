                <br>
                <p class="info">
                    Did you know? Hair breakage, split ends, hair thinning or hair loss is a concern for 64% of people
                    in
                    the world.Scalp health is important to help prevent hair loss. A scalp that’s unhealthy tends to
                    produce
                    unhealthy hair, which is weaker and more prone to breakage or split ends.Additionally, itchy scalp
                    due
                    to dandruff can cause you to scratch, which can also cause further physical damage and more hair
                    breakage.

                    <b>Thinning Hair For Women</b><br>
                    Head & Shoulders scientists have found out that dandruff weakens hair: Hair
                    growing from a dandruff-irritated scalp has more surface damage, and a weaker protein structure.
                    Scratching can also contribute to hair damage. Weak hair is more prone to break.
                    <br>
                    Fortunately, there is a way to keep hair strong: using Head & Shoulders regularly. Head & shoulders’
                    shampoo helps keep scalp in
                    good shape by prevent dandruff-related hair damage, so your hair can be healthy and strong.

                    <p>
                        Our scientists have found thathair growing from a dandruff-irritated scalp is already more damaged
                    than hair from a healthy scalp – and that’s before you start scratching. The weakened cuticle
                    surface provides less protection to the hair fiber as itgrows and could leave you more likely to
                    experience hair loss due to breakage.
